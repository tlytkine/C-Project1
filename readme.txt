Computer Architecture Project 1 
(I worked on this myself)

In order to test the code, in the project1.c file, I have made test cases for all of the ques and ans functions and you can simply input different numbers for the parameters for each function and then compile them and it will print what the function returns in this manner: 
Test for ques1:
Test for ans1: 
and so onâ€¦ 

In order to compile the function you simply need to cd to the directory in which project1.c is located in and then run this in the command line:

gcc -o project1 -std=c99 project1.c 

Then in order to run it you simply run:

./project1 

To edit the function to test to see what each ques and ans function does and to confirm that they are equivalent, simply run:

pico project1.c 

and adjust the values for each function accordingly.

I only simplified the functions for which I could think of better ways to write the code. Some of them were too complex for me to fully comprehend how to simplify them.
